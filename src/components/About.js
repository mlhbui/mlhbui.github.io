        <h3>Hello, I am a software engineer based in Portland, OR. </h3>
        I focus on building reliable, scalable, and user-centric applications. 
        With experience across the full software development lifecycle, I have designed and deployed systems using React, Node.js, and Python within Agile teams.
        <br />
        <br />
        In my recent role with the BullyBlocker Project, I led the development of intuitive user interfaces to identify postive design patterns and mitigate online harassment.         
        I'm particularly passionate about accessible design and the potential for emerging technologies like AI/ML to drive innovation. 

        <br />
        <br />
        I’m eager to apply my skills to projects that prioritize ethical technology and inclusivity. 
        Beyond coding, I enjoy traveling, reading, and exploring hiking trails in the PNW.
